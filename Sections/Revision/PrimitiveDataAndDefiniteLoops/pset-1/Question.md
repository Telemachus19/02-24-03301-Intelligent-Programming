In physics, a common useful equation for finding the position $s$ of a body in linear motion at a given time $t$, based
on its initial position $s_0$, initial velocity $v_0$, and rate of acceleration a, is the following: $$s = s_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$$
Write code to declare variables for $s_0$,$v_0$,$a$, and $t$, and then write the code to compute s on the basis of these values.
