The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of integers in which the first two elements are 1, and each following element is the sum of the two preceding elements. The mathematical definition of each $k$th Fibonacci number is the
following:
$$
F(k) = \begin{cases}
    F(k - 1) + F(k -2) & k > 2 \\
    1 & k \le 2
\end{cases}
$$
The first 12 Fibonacci numbers are
`1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144`
